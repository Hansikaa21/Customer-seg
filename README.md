# Customer Segmentation using Gaussian Mixture Models
Customer Segmentation using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

This project performs customer segmentation using the Customer Personality Analysis dataset. It uses Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to identify different customer groups based on demographics and spending behavior.

Features

> Loads and cleans the marketing dataset

> Converts Dt_Customer to datetime and creates Customer_For feature

> Encodes categorical variables

> Scales all numeric features

> Applies PCA for visualization

> Runs GMM for components 2 to 10

> Compares AIC, BIC, and Silhouette Score

> Selects best number of clusters

> Generates cluster summary and PCA scatter plot

Outputs

> Correlation heatmap

> PCA 2D visualization

> AIC, BIC, and Silhouette Score plots

> Best number of clusters

> Cluster summary table

> Final PCA cluster scatter plot
